 >JavaScript:

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.zip.sha256

 >HTML:

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web page by using a variety of tags and attributes. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites, allowing for the embedding of images, text, videos, forms, and other content

 >CSS:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used most often to style and improve upon the appearance of websites. It allows for the separation of presentation and content, and includes the characteristics of layouts, colors and fonts. CSS builds upon HTML to make webpages more interactive and appealing to the user.

> THREE JS:

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) that allows you to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. It acts as a layer of abstraction over the WebGL API, making it easier for developers to work with 3D graphics without dealing directly with low-level WebGL code
